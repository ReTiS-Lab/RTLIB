        -Modified the add resource function in order to manage the same resource in differents managers.
        -Added a new request method to support the lock of global resource by task inside a server.
        -Added find methods to search if a resource is present in the manager by pointer or name.
        -Added getResScope methods to get the scope or a resource by pointer or name.
